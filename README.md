# Investigate-A-Dataset: ***Finding Correlations Among Seemingly Unrelated Variables***
 
 
## Motivation

For this project I gathered data from 4 different datasets off of Gapminder, assessed and cleaned the data, and stored it all in a final, clean CSV. Afterwards, I posed my own research questions, explored the data, and reported my findings.

## Introduction

**Broad question:** How do total forest area and frequency of natural disasters shape a country's obesity rates and murder rates?

> I picked these factors which seem to be unrelated: frequency of natural disasters, to rates of obesity and murder, to formulate new interesting questions and uncover unexpected patterns. I also wanted to approach this project through an experimental and free-for-all lens, just to see if I can make any fun or comical conclusions from the giving unrelated datasets. I received all of my data through GapMinder.

Here is a breakdown of my final clean CSV's features, `gapminder_all.csv`:

- **country**
- **year**

***Natural Disasters***
- **drought_killed** 
- **earthquake_killed**
- **epidemic_killed**
- **flood_killed**
- **storm_killed**

***Total forest area in square kilometers***
- **total_forest_area**

***Average bmi rate by country and year***
- **female_bmi**
- **male_bmi**

***Counts of death by murder per 100,000***
- **murder rate** 

## Research Questions

**Question 1:** Which country has the highest homicide rate? What about just country? Or year? Is this an outlier?

**Question 2:** Do countries with less forest area tend to have higher rates of death by drought?

**Question 3:** How much have global obesity rates changed in countries with high forest area vs. countries with low forest area?

**Question 4:** Does a countryâ€™s likelihood of experiencing a natural disaster correlate with the homicidal tendencies of its citizens?
